    "EncyDesc_TertiaryOutpostTerminal3": "An alien outpost, likely used as a charging system for powered devices.\n\n1. Data Terminal:\nAn alien data terminal with a blue holographic symbol. Contains co-ordinates pointing to two secondary outposts.\n\n2. Charging device:\nA claw-shaped device that can output large amounts of energy, from an unknown source.\n\n3. Orange Tablet:\nA rare alien artifact. It was likely put here for future use, but was never reclaimed.",
    "Ency_SupplyCacheTerminal": "Resource Storage Facility",
    "EncyDesc_SupplyCacheTerminal": "This large structure appears to be designed to hold valuabe resources for potential future use.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Large pillar-shaped storage units line either side of the interior. The materials inside are condensed as far as physically possible in order to maintain a minuscule volume.\n- Several exploitable mineral deposits are found loosely scattered in the base. A potential reason for this is an overflow of dedicated storage.\n- Several small alien structural alloy ingots are on display in the base. Their purpose appears to be aesthetic. Retrieval methods are still unknown.\n- The arch-like structure situated in the back of the cache, if not decorational, was likely used for quick transportation of supplies.",
    "Ency_ResearchBaseTerminal": "Weapons Research Facility",
    "EncyDesc_ResearchBaseTerminal": "This outpost acted as a hub for the testing of extremely destructive technology. Examples of this technology include a powerful ionic pulse defense mechanism, a kind of sentry unit, and a uniquely designed weapon.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Lacking extensive decorations and structures, this base appears to be solely dedicated to research of destructive technology.\n- Mentions of a project under the name \"GUARDIAN\" are present, but any files that may have pertained to this project are either missing, corrupt, or encrypted.\n- The development and usage of this technology appears to have contributed to the destruction of the local ecosystem, which was once flourishing with life.\n\nThe technology in this base may be exploited for personal use. Use with caution.",

    "Ency_RuinedGuardian": "Mysterious Wreckage",
    "EncyDesc_RuinedGuardian": "The shattered remains of a vast alien machine.\n\n1. Purpose:\nThe exact purpose of this device remains vague, but the hydrodynamic build, reinforced structure and various defence mechanisms suggest a mobile sentry. It was presumably tasked with guarding a location of significant importance from nearby roaming leviathan class lifeforms.\n\n2. Damage:\nAnalysis of the wreck reveals extensive damage in various places, which resulted in a near total system failure. The damage is consistent with being crushed, despite the extraordinary integrity of the construction material. The current state of the remains indicate the incident occurred recently and within the vicinity, despite no obvious culprit being found nearby. Whatever its purpose, it has obviously failed.\n\nAssessment: Further Research Required. Caution is advised.",

    "Ency_VoidBaseTerminal": "Omega Research Apparatus",
    "EncyDesc_VoidBaseTerminal": "This data terminal contains schematics and statistics relating to the facility. Analysis is shown below.\n\nDue to the outbreak of the kharaa bacterium, the aliens were desperate to develop a vaccine. The only known cure at the time, found in the last known 'Emperor', is too diluted to provide any definite use.\n\nDue to belief that more of these Emperors may exist, far away from the crater, this apparatus was constructed. While initially appearing similar to any other alien structure on the planet, with the primary focus being research, schematics show an odd ability to expand downwards over half a kilometer, exposing a significant number of complex machines.\n\nThis machinery was designed to communicate with and attract any stray Emperors. Obviously, this plan has failed. However, it did attract another unusual juvenile specimen.\n\nThe base was eventually repurposed for vaccine development studies and a project under the name \"OMEGA\".",
    "Ency_GuardianTailfin": "Alien Machine Tail Segment",
    "EncyDesc_GuardianTailfin": "The tail of some sort of segmented machine. A lack of obvious damage suggests it was designed for intentional uncoupling when in danger.",
    "Ency_SecondaryBaseModel": "Cache Structure",
    "EncyDesc_SecondaryBaseModel": "A large structure with a mysterious design, used as long-term storage of data and resources. The entrance is forcefield-protected and airlocked, most likely to protect the valuables inside.",
    "Ency_VoidBaseModel": "Suspended Platform",
    "EncyDesc_VoidBaseModel": "A massive structure, over 300 meters in height. It is impossible to determine any applications of a base this large in such a dangerous area.\n\nThe unique design with the majority of the interior being inaccessible suggests a non-conventional use. More information may be located inside the structure.",
    "Ency_PrecursorIngot": "Alien Structural Alloy",

These co-ordinates have been uploaded to your PDA.\n\nLocational data:\n- Sanctuary Alpha: Found in the depths of a barren biome. Requires a purple tablet.\n- Sanctuary Beta: Found deep underwater in a dark cave system. Requires a purple tablet.\n- Sanctuary Cappa: Found near a mysterious crater. Requires a purple tablet.\n- Laboratory: Found in a frigid cave system. Requires an orange tablet.\n\nCo-ordinates that are unusually pointing to the equator have not been uploaded. Traveling that far of a distance would be close to impossible.",
    "Ency_PrecursorRifle": "Alien Rifle Variant",
    "EncyDesc_PrecursorRifle": "This weapon strongly resembles a similar alien device found on the planet. The coloration however appears more close to the distinct architectural style of the aliens. Being powered by ion energy, it must have been extremely powerful.",
    "Ency_PrecursorBlade": "Alien Knife",
    "EncyDesc_PrecursorBlade": "An alien knife with obvious applications. The material that composes the blade cannot be identified. It has some resemblance to an Ion Cube, but is a different color and appears to contain several times as much energy. Further research required.",
    "Ency_PrecursorBuilder": "Alien Construction Tool",
    "EncyDesc_PrecursorBuilder": "An ancient construction tool that appears uncannily similar to the Alterra Habitat Builder.\n\nThis device was likely used to design and create large structures with ease, including all of the alien structures found on the planet. The fact that it has been left in stasis on site suggests this was the last structure it has ever built.",

    "EncyDesc_BabyGargSkeleton": "The skeletal remains of a leviathan specimen, encased in a sealed environment, with few signs of decay. Judging by the bone structure and density, it was likely a juvenile specimen. Carbon dating suggests it has died approximately one thousand years ago.\n\nRelative intactness of the bones suggests it has died of starvation or another natural cause. It was likely abandoned after a certain event.\n\nInterestingly, the ancient ecosystem inside the tank is still thriving, and has no signs of Kharra affecting it.",
    "Ency_ResearchBaseSingularity": "Contained Singularity",
    "EncyDesc_ResearchBaseSingularity": "A highly unstable object with immeasurably high mass contained via gravity manipulation. If released it could absorb the entire solar system in a relatively short amount of time. It was likely designed to be used as a weapon, a quarantine failsafe option, or at the very least a way to intimidate other species. If that is true, it has certainly succeeded.\n\nAssessment: Do not touch.",
