we are also using [Assembly Publicizer](https://github.com/MrPurple6411/Bepinex-Tools/releases/tag/1.0.0-Publicizer) BepInEx plugin by [MrPurple6411](https://github.com/MrPurple6411) to have an easier time to deal with private methods & field so if you dont have it already, make sure to set it up.  

you will need to copy the genarated publicized `Assembly-CSharp_publicized.dll` and `Assembly-CSharp-firstpass_publicized.dll` to the `Dependencies` folder.
